A record producer is a specific type of catalog item that allows end users to create task-based records such as:
- incident records from the service catalog.

Record producers are used to provide a better end-user experience instead of using the regular task-based form for creating records.

The look and feel of a record producer is similar to that of a catalog item. But the record producer generates a task record such 
as incident, instead of a requested item.

You can create a record producer for tables and database views that are in the same scope as the record producer. 
You can also create a record producer for tables that allow create access from applications in other scopes.

Note:
-Use a record producer to create task-based records only.
-To ensure that standard service catalog processes are followed, such as initiating workflows as expected, do not 
create requested item records from record producers. Instead, create requested item using catalog items.
