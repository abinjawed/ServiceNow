*Inheritance is a mechanism in which an object acquires properties and methods of a parent object.

An advantage of inheritance is code reusability.

A class is a group of objects with common properties.

Multiple Inheritance is not supported by Java, because it's like a child of divorced parents
who now has a stepdad and a regular dad. He calls out, "Hey, dad!" but this creates confusion.
and ambiguity.

*Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

Polymorphism occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

Method Overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods of the same name but with
different parameters. 

Different ways of Method overloading:
-changing number of parameters.
-changing data type of parameters, ie, int-int and int-float.
-changing the sequence of data type of parameters, ie, int-float and float-int.

*Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.

The purpose of encapsulation is to add privacy to the data.

The Access Modifiers dictate the level of privacy of the data, such as:
-private
-default
-protected
-public

*Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to
the user.

Abstraction allows the user to focus on what the object does, and not how it does it.
