------------------------------------BUDGET REPORT------------------------------------------

What is a Budget Report?
Budget reports are documents that present a single company’s various budgets at any given time. 
Examples of budgets include operations, production, sales and marketing. 
The goal of a budget report is to determine how much each area is given in funds and how well 
the departments use their given funds to reach the goals of the business. 
A budget report only shows the company’s incoming and outgoing cash flow and expenses, so the 
report does not reveal how well the company is doing -- only how it spends its available money.

A budget report is written to show how a given business is managing its funding. 
It is prepared by accountants and reviewed by managers and executives responsible for operations and production. 
The purpose is to see how the company spends its available funds and how much is available for new products, for example. 
An annual financial report is written for investors and shareholders who are interested in getting updated information from the company. 
Some investors use the financial report as primary research for potential investments.
