API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine 
definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set 
of clearly defined methods of communication among various components.
 
A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, 
which are then put together by the programmer.

An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, 
or software library.

An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, 
data structures, object classes, variables, or remote calls.
Documentation for the API usually is provided to facilitate usage and 
implementation.

An API usually is related to a software library. The API describes and prescribes the 
"expected behavior" (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of 
this set of rules.

A single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of 
different libraries that share the same programming interface.
