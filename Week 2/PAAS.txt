
PaaS
---------------------------

-We offer PaaS (Platform as a Service).
	- PaaS is a category of cloud computing services.
	- PaaS provides platform to allow customers/clients to develop 
	and manage an app, minus the hassle of having to build and 
	maintain the complex infrastructure of buidling and maintaining
	an appl.
	- PaaS can be delivered in 2 ways:
		- As a public cloud service, wherein the consumer controls
		software deployment and configuration settings... this is
		where provider steps in and provides network servers and 
		storage to host the consumer's application.
		- As a software installed in private data centers... here
		it is managed by an internal IT department. The provider
		will simplify the code-writing process for developers
		by providing them infrastructure and handle operations.

- Originally, all platforms were in the public cloud.. but then companies 
did not want to have their information accessible by the public. Thus,
the private and hybrid options were created.

- PaaS provides companies and developers the environment to create, host,
and deploy applications.

- PaaS tackles the complexities of setting up, configuring, and managing 
elements (such as servers and databases).

- PaaS speeds up the process of developing an app.

- PaaS allows the consumer to focus on the app itself.

- PaaS allows the consumer to manage the app... while the provider manages:
	- runtime
	- middleware
	- operating system
	- virtualization
	- servers
	- storage
	- networking

- The vendor can provide development tools.
- The vendor can customize development tools according to user needs.

- The user can choose to maintain the software or have the vendor maintain it.

- PaaS can provide facilities for:
	- application design
	- application development
	- testing
	- deployment
	- team collaboration
	- web service integration
	- marshalling database integration
	- security
	- scalability
	- application version upgrade
	- developer community facilitation
