GlideAjax is a combination of tools, employing:
  - Client Side codes (Client Script)
  - Server Side codes (Script Include)

The client JS code commands the server, "Please run this function." 
The server JS code says, "Okay, here you go." This JS conversation between them occurs in XML.

The server can follow the client's command in 2 ways:
  - Synchronous: The server makes the client wait, so there is a 2-3 second load time, which
                 can cause bad User Experience.
  - Asynchronous: The client uses a callback function that triggers a client script once
                  the server sends the result to the client. Basically, the server fetches
                  the client a piece of info without making him stand idly by... the code 
                  notifies server, keeps the client proccupied with other fields to fill
                  out or click on other thingss, and then bring him back the info once the
                  extra fields are filled out.

The beauty of Ajax is you can retrieve a lot of information before having to hit "Submit."
