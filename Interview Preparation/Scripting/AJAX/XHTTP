XHTTP (Extended Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

The XHTTP lets you abstract an API across a network as services, similar to web services using protocols such as SOAP, 
enabling remote and distributed platforms for both private and public consumption.

XHTTP differs from other protocols in that all request and response metadata are sent as headers. 
This significantly reduces the transport overhead involved with other solutions by integrating the process into the protocol itself.

The extension to the base protocol defines the process of constructing a request and generating a response, as well as adding 
additional headers and status codes, and finally, defining an XML schema to describe the services and actions available at the URI. 
Features such as TLS, authentification, caching and streaming are also available when using XHTTP.

XHTTP allows for both primitive and complex data types, sent to the server as query string parameters and defined in the 
Arguments header of the request, and received by the client in the response body and defined in the Return header.

If the request were to be processed successfully, the following XHTTP response headers and body would be returned to the client:

  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
  Date: Sat, 18 May 2019 16:16:06 GMT 
  Return: 5
  ['James Watts','Madrid','Spain']

However, in the event that an error were to occur, an exception would be thrown as the response, for example:

  HTTP/1.0 550 Exception
  Date: Sat, 18 May 2019 16:16:06 GMT 
  Exception: You must pass a string of text;9

Allowing services to throw exceptions at the protocol level gives them the ability to be chained and combined together without 
needing to introduce fault tolerance into the application logic. This gives the protocol control over the flow of their execution, 
by handling exceptions as part of the communication process between requests.
