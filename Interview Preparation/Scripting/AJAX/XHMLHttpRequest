The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a web server behind the scenes. 
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE7+, Edge, Safari, Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.


Some Properties Of XMLHttpRequest:
- onreadystatechange --> an eventhandler that is called whenever the readyState attribute changes.
- readyState --> returns the state in which the client is, which can be:
   
   Value	  State	              Description
     0	    UNSENT	            Client has been created. open() not called yet.
     1	    OPENED	            open() has been called.
     2	    HEADERS_RECEIVED	  send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
     3	    LOADING	            Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
     4	    DONE	              The operation is complete.

- status property --> returns the numerical HTTP status code of the XMLHttpRequest's response:

100 range (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
200 range (Successful):    The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
300 range (Redirection):   Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
400 range (Client Error):  The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
500 range (Server Error):  The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

- responseText --> returns the text received from a server following a request being sent.
- open() --> initializes a newly-created request, or re-initializes an existing one.
- send() --> sends the request to the server. 
If the request is asynchronous (which is the default), this method returns as soon as the 
request is sent and the result is delivered using events. 
If the request is synchronous, this method doesn't return until the response has arrived.
