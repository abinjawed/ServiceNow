AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. 

But what does the 'angular' in AngularJS actually mean?
It's called 'angular' because its framework is inside HTML tags, which are written using angle brackets<>.

AngularJS can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag:
        
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>


AngularJS:  - extends HTML attributes with Directives
            - binds data to HTML with Expressions



AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives:
 -The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
 -The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
 -The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.
