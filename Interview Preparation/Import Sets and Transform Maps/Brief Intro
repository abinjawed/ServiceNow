Import Sets and Transform Maps are a great way to bring data into ServiceNow for integrations. 
 
By pairing Import Sets with Scripted REST, you can keep the great usability of existing 
Transform Maps while adding in your own powerful preprocessing, custom error messages, 
ability to handle more complex data sets and even manipulate field names from incoming data sources.
